# AdaptUX

### Design that adapts. Technology that understands. Experiences that include.

AdaptUX is a technology initiative focused on building tools that make digital experiences more adaptable, inclusive, and human-centered.

We believe every person interacts with technology differently — in attention, perception, reading patterns, sensory preferences, and cognitive load.
Our mission is to ensure that digital interfaces can recognize these differences and adjust gracefully, without labeling, assumptions, or invasive data.

## Our Core Principles

### 1. Adaptation over standardization

Interfaces should adapt to people — not force people to adapt to interfaces.

### 2. Inclusion without identification

We never infer, store, or expose personal diagnoses.
We design for comfort, autonomy, and choice.

### 3. Respect by default

All adaptive behaviors must be optional, reversible, and transparent.

### 4. Science-driven, human-validated

We combine evidence-based design, behavioral heuristics, and real user testing to shape meaningful and safe experiences.

### 5. Framework-agnostic technology

Our tools work everywhere — from enterprise platforms to simple static sites.

### 6. Developer-first architecture

We build modular, scalable SDKs that integrate cleanly into modern workflows.

## What We Build

### NeuroUX SDK

A multi-layer adaptive experience framework that enhances focus, readability, sensory comfort, and cognitive accessibility through subtle interactive adjustments.

## Our Vision

A world where digital environments respond to human cognitive diversity as naturally as they respond to screen sizes.
Where comfort, clarity, and focus are not special features — but standard expectations.

## Open Collaboration

AdaptUX is open to developers, researchers, designers, educators, and organizations interested in building a more inclusive digital future.
We welcome contributions, research, discussions, and experimentation.

Together, we can redefine what “accessible” means — moving beyond compliance toward truly adaptive experiences.
